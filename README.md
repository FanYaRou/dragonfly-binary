## DragonFly Binary Edition
### What did i do?
- I compiled the source code of DragonFly and made some distributable binary that is compatible with multiple platforms.
### What's the benefit of that?
- Now, you don't need to download the Golang runtime and manually compile with go run main.go. All you need to do is easily double-click/use the terminal to run the corresponding version of the binary, and you can easily launch the DragonFly server.
### How many platforms are binaries currently made?
- Currently, I have built the DragonFly executable for Windows, Linux, MacOS and Android, you can find what you love, choose the platform you want to run the DragonFly server, and run it!

***Attention!*** This project is still experimental, and the compiled binaries are uncertain if they will work stably. If you have any questions, please file an issue now!
